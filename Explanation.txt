Certainly! Here's a summary of the key changes I made to refactor the code and improve it using a constructor and OOP principles:

---

### **1. Constructor Initialization**
- **What Changed**: Added an `__init__` method to initialize common configurations.
- **Why**: To centralize the setup of logging, MongoDB connection, scheduler, and file types in one place.
- **Details**:
  - Moved logging configuration into the constructor.
  - Initialized MongoDB connection (`self.client`, `self.db`, `self.logs_collection`).
  - Set up the scheduler (`self.scheduler`).
  - Defined file types for organization (`self.file_types`).
  - Loaded and scheduled existing tasks during initialization (`self.load_and_schedule_tasks()`).

---

### **2. Logging Improvements**
- **What Changed**: Replaced direct `logging` calls with `self.logger` for consistency.
- **Why**: To make logging more modular and easier to manage within the class.
- **Details**:
  - Created a class-level logger (`self.logger`) in the constructor.
  - Updated all logging calls to use `self.logger.info()`, `self.logger.error()`, etc.

---

### **3. MongoDB Logging**
- **What Changed**: Moved MongoDB logging into a dedicated method (`log_to_mongodb`).
- **Why**: To avoid code duplication and make logging to MongoDB reusable.
- **Details**:
  - Created a method `log_to_mongodb` that takes `task_name`, `details`, `status`, and `level` as arguments.
  - Replaced all direct MongoDB logging calls with this method.

---

### **4. Task Storage**
- **What Changed**: Moved task storage logic into methods (`load_tasks`, `save_tasks`).
- **Why**: To encapsulate file I/O operations and make the code cleaner.
- **Details**:
  - Added `load_tasks` to load tasks from the JSON file.
  - Added `save_tasks` to save tasks to the JSON file.

---

### **5. Scheduler Integration**
- **What Changed**: Moved scheduler setup and task scheduling into the constructor and dedicated methods.
- **Why**: To ensure the scheduler is initialized and tasks are loaded when the class is instantiated.
- **Details**:
  - Initialized the scheduler in the constructor (`self.scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()`).
  - Added `load_and_schedule_tasks` to load and schedule tasks from the JSON file.

---

### **6. Task Methods**
- **What Changed**: Encapsulated each task's functionality into separate methods.
- **Why**: To make the code modular and easier to maintain.
- **Details**:
  - Added methods like `organize_files`, `delete_files`, `send_email`, `get_gold_rate`, `convert_file`, and `compress_files`.
  - Each method handles its specific task and logs actions to MongoDB.

---

### **7. CLI Integration**
- **What Changed**: Moved CLI argument parsing and task management into the class.
- **Why**: To make the CLI interface more modular and reusable.
- **Details**:
  - Added methods like `add_task`, `remove_task`, and `list_tasks` to handle CLI commands.
  - Used `argparse` to parse CLI arguments and call the appropriate methods.

---

### **8. Error Handling**
- **What Changed**: Improved error handling in all methods.
- **Why**: To ensure the program doesn't crash unexpectedly and logs errors properly.
- **Details**:
  - Added `try-except` blocks in all methods to catch and log exceptions.
  - Used `self.logger.error` to log errors and `log_to_mongodb` to log errors to MongoDB.

---

### **9. Code Reusability**
- **What Changed**: Made methods reusable by passing arguments instead of hardcoding values.
- **Why**: To make the class more flexible and adaptable to different use cases.
- **Details**:
  - For example, `organize_files` takes `directory` as an argument instead of hardcoding it.
  - Similarly, `delete_files` takes `directory`, `age_days`, and `formats` as arguments.

---

### **10. Task Scheduling**
- **What Changed**: Moved task scheduling logic into the `add_task` method.
- **Why**: To centralize task scheduling and make it easier to add new tasks.
- **Details**:
  - The `add_task` method takes `interval`, `unit`, `task_type`, and additional task-specific arguments.
  - It creates a unique task name, schedules the task, and saves it to the JSON file.

---

### **11. Load and Schedule Tasks**
- **What Changed**: Added a method to load and schedule tasks from the JSON file.
- **Why**: To ensure tasks are restored when the program restarts.
- **Details**:
  - The `load_and_schedule_tasks` method reads tasks from the JSON file and schedules them using the scheduler.

---

### **12. Start Scheduler**
- **What Changed**: Moved scheduler startup logic into a method (`start_scheduler`).
- **Why**: To make it easier to start the scheduler from the CLI or other parts of the code.
- **Details**:
  - The `start_scheduler` method starts the scheduler and keeps the main thread alive.

---

### **13. CLI Argument Parsing**
- **What Changed**: Moved CLI argument parsing into the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
- **Why**: To separate the CLI interface from the class logic.
- **Details**:
  - Used `argparse` to parse CLI arguments and call the appropriate methods (`add_task`, `remove_task`, `list_tasks`, etc.).

---

### **14. Constructor for File Types**
- **What Changed**: Defined file types for organization in the constructor.
- **Why**: To make the file types reusable across methods.
- **Details**:
  - Added `self.file_types` in the constructor to store file extensions and their corresponding categories.

---

### **15. Improved Code Structure**
- **What Changed**: Organized the code into logical sections (initialization, task methods, scheduler methods, CLI interface).
- **Why**: To make the code easier to read, maintain, and extend.
- **Details**:
  - Grouped related methods together (e.g., file organization, file deletion, email automation, etc.).
  - Added comments to explain each section.

---

### **Summary of Benefits**
1. **Encapsulation**: All functionality is encapsulated within the `TaskManager` class.
2. **Reusability**: Methods are reusable and can be called from other parts of the code.
3. **Modularity**: Each task is handled by a separate method, making the code modular.
4. **Scalability**: Adding new tasks or modifying existing ones is straightforward.
5. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling ensures the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.
6. **Logging**: Centralized logging makes it easier to track task execution and errors.
7. **CLI Integration**: The CLI interface is modular and easy to use.
